Post-COVID Layoffs Analysis: A Exploratory Data Analysis Project in SQL

In this project, I utilized SQL to clean and analyse data related to layoffs across various industries following the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset included raw, unstructured information on layoffs, which required extensive cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Key steps in the data cleaning process included handling missing values, correcting data types, standardizing industry classifications, and removing duplicates. After the data cleaning phase, I conducted a thorough analysis to identify trends and patterns in layoffs across different industries.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL for data cleaning and my ability to transform messy data into a structured format, enabling insightful analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic on various sectors.

Tools Used: SQL
